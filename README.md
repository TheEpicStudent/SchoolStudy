# About This Website

## Purpose
I have issues focusing without music or background ambience, so I created this website. Creating this website has been a very fun (and stressful) project. As it continues to evolve, I will add more things, like a noise generator and a lofi player. I feel that everyone should have the chance to be able to focus without advertisements or annoying pop-ups.
